# WAYFARER UX CONCEPT


**Wayfarer is a travel planner for superheroes. It is the easiest to find the fastest route to your destination. **

Adding cities along the way is a breeze. And its just as easy to avoid cities that you know you canâ€™t be seen in at the moment. 

This document outline the app interface of wayfarer.

## Process

 * Information architecture and flow.
 * First interface ideas and flows. Some of the ideas were kept, some were dismissed.
 * Wireframes of the interface and interactions
 * HTML prototype to showcase the flow and interactions in a native environment.
